        <p class="text-lg text-card-foreground/90">
          At Rollercoaster.dev, we're crafting a unique platform centered around 
          <a href="https://openbadges.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:underline font-semibold">Open Badges</a>, 
          designed specifically for the neurodivergent experience.

        <p class="text-card-foreground/80">
          Imagine a place where you can:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-card-foreground/80">
          <li>
            <strong>Track and showcase progress</strong> on *any* goal that matters to you – learning, work, hobbies, community action, personal growth, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visualize your journey</strong> and achievements in meaningful ways.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Easily pause and restart</strong> your activities, with support to pick things back up, especially during challenging times like burnout or low motivation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connect with a community</strong> for validation, shared learning, and mutual support.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-primary">Our Vision: Tools Built From Lived Experience</h2>
        <p class="text-foreground/90">
          Standard productivity tools often fall short for neurodivergent individuals. Rigid schedules and linear lists don't always align with how our minds work best. We understand that neurodivergent strengths are different, and navigating goals requires tools that offer flexibility, clear steps, and genuine understanding – not just another calendar.
        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground/90">
          At Rollercoaster.dev, our vision is simple: 
          <strong class="text-accent">Create the tools we wish existed, built *by* and *for* the neurodivergent community.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-foreground/80">
          Our goals are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li>
            <strong>To empower users</strong> by breaking down overwhelming goals into manageable, actionable steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To offer flexibility</strong>, allowing individuals to pursue their objectives in a way that adapts to their fluctuating energy and focus, free from rigid timelines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To foster a community</strong> built on shared understanding and mutual support, where connecting with others who navigate similar challenges helps everyone grow – because we know the power of shared stories and truly 'getting it'.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-foreground/90">
          We're building this because we understand the need firsthand. It's about creating solutions that embrace and support the diverse ways neurodivergent minds thrive.

          <li>
            <strong>Core Engine (Near Completion - Alpha):</strong> We're finalizing the backend API (`bun-badges`) and shared data structures (`openbadges-types`) based on the Open Badges standard. These form the foundation of the platform.

          <li>
            <strong>Building Blocks (Next Up):</strong> Development will begin on a library of reusable interface components (Vue) specifically for interacting with Open Badges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Platform (Planned):</strong> Bringing it all together into an intuitive workspace (`badges.rollercoaster.dev`) where users can manage, visualize, and share their badges and learning journeys.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community & Growth (Ongoing/Future):</strong> We're actively seeking neurodivergent collaborators to join the development and design effort. Following the initial build, we'll focus on securing funding and initiating testing phases.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text-card-foreground/90">
          We're excited about building this incrementally and transparently with the community.
