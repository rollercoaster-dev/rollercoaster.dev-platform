# Theme Support in Storybook

import { Meta } from '@storybook/blocks';

<Meta title="Guides/Theme Support" />

## Using the Dark Mode Addon

This project has been set up with the `storybook-dark-mode` addon, which allows you to easily toggle between light and dark themes for your components. The theme toggle is available in the Storybook toolbar.

## How to Use Theme Support in Your Stories

There are two ways to make your stories work with the dark mode addon:

### 1. Using the global decorator (automatic)

All stories automatically receive theme support through the global decorator defined in `.storybook/preview.ts`. The decorator adds the `dark` class when dark mode is active, which then triggers the Tailwind dark mode styling.

### 2. Using the `withTheme` decorator (manual)

For more control over theming in specific stories, you can use the `withTheme` decorator:

```ts
import { withTheme } from '../.storybook/preview';

export const ThemedComponent: Story = {
  args: {
    // Component props
  },
  decorators: [withTheme],
};
```

## Example Theme Implementation

Here is an example of how component styling works with the theme system:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="bg-background text-foreground p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Card Title</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">This card adapts to the current theme.</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

The `bg-background` and `text-foreground` classes use CSS variables defined in our tailwind theme, which change based on the `dark` class being present or not.

## Testing Components in Both Themes

When testing components, you can add specific tests for both light and dark themes. For example:

```ts
it('displays correctly in light mode', async () => {
  // Test light mode appearance
});

it('displays correctly in dark mode', async () => {
  // Add the dark class to the document
  document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
  
  // Test dark mode appearance
  
  // Clean up
  document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
});
```
