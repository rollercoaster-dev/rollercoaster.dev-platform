# Market Viability and Funding Feasibility for a Neurodivergent-Focused Non-Profit Software Platform in Germany

---

## Market Landscape for Non-Profit Educational Software

### Growth Trends and Sector Opportunities

The global **non-profit software market** is projected to grow at a **CAGR of 7.98%**, reaching **€6.74 billion by 2030**[^2]. In Germany, this growth is accelerated by:

- **Digital Transformation**: 89% of non-profits now prioritize digital tools for operational efficiency and donor engagement[^2].
- **AI Integration**: Platforms like Qgiv’s Fundraising Intelligence demonstrate demand for AI-driven solutions that reduce administrative burdens while maintaining human-centric values[^2].
- **EU Policy Alignment**: Horizon Europe’s "Mission on Mental Health" and Germany’s **Partizipationsgesetz** create funding tailwinds for neurodiversity-focused EdTech[^2][^5].

For neurodivergent learning platforms, the **SME segment** (targeting small teams) shows the strongest growth potential at **~8% CAGR**, driven by cloud-based solutions priced under €200/month[^2].

| **Source** | **Amount** | **Use Case** | **Salary Eligibility** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Prototype Fund**[^1][^4] | €47,500 over 6 months | Open-source software development | Yes (up to €70k/year for lead developer) |
| **EXIST Grant**[^7] | €3,000/month per founder | Pre-seed tech ventures | Founder salaries + 2 employees |
| **DFG Research Software**[^5] | Up to €300,000 over 3 years | Research-aligned infrastructure | Yes (technical staff + project leadership) |

**Example Budget for 3-Person Team (First Year):**

- **Development Costs**: €98,000 (2 FT developers @ €45k, 1 UX designer @ €38k)
- **Funding Mix**:
    - €47,500 (Prototype Fund)
    - €36,000 (EXIST for 2 founders)

### Salary Benchmarks in German Non-Profit Tech

| **Role** | **Median Salary** | **Grant Allowance** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Founder/Executive Dir | €70k–€90k[^3][^7] | Up to 100% via EXIST/Prototype Fund[^4][^7] |
| Senior Developer | €65k | 80–100% via DFG/Prototype Fund[^1][^5] |
| UX Researcher | €52k | 50–70% via EU Horizon Health grants[^2] |

**Key Insight**: Non-profit founder salaries in Germany average **23% below venture-backed peers**[^3], but grants like EXIST permit market-rate compensation if tied to technical roles[^7].

## Strategic Funding Acquisition

### Phase 1: Prototyping (Months 0–6)

1. **Secure Prototype Fund Grant**:
    - Emphasize open-source credentials and neurodivergent co-design.
    - Allocate €30k to developer salaries, €12k to testing stipends, €5.5k to hosting[^1].
2. **Leverage EXIST Startup Grant**:
    - Claim €3,000/month for 2 founders while incorporating as gUG[^7].

### Phase 2: Scaling (Months 7–18)

1. **Apply for DFG Research Software Grant**:
    - Position the platform as "research infrastructure" for neurodiversity studies[^5].
    - Budget €150k over 3 years for AI credentialing features.
2. **Pursue Horizon Europe Mental Health Funding**:
    - Target €200k for clinical validation studies with DZNE partners[^2].

## Risks and Mitigations

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** | **Grant Alignment** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Over-reliance on single grant | Diversify with CSR partnerships (e.g., SAP Autism at Work) | Prototype Fund + EXIST[^1][^7] |
| Salary caps limiting hiring | Use stipends for neurodivergent testers (€500/month via Aktion Mensch) | DFG allows 20% stipend allocation[^5] |
| Delayed revenue generation | Monetize API access to researchers @ €0.003/request | Horizon Europe permits commercial spin-offs[^2] |

## Conclusion

Yes, Germany’s non-profit software funding ecosystem can support a neurodivergent learning platform with salaries for a small team. Strategic steps include:

1. **Immediately apply** for Prototype Fund (deadline: November 2024) and EXIST grants.
2. **Structure as gUG** to access 95% grant-covered budgets while paying founder salaries[^4].
3. **Combine grants** to reach €120k–€150k in Year 1, covering 3–4 roles at 60–80% market rates.

With 73% of German EdTech projects securing public funding within 18 months[^2][^5], and neurodiversity tech being a Horizon Europe priority, the platform is both viable and fundable.
