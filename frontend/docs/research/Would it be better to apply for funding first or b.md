# Would it be better to apply for funding first or build a prototype?

---
**Answer:**
For a neurodivergent-focused open-source project in Germany, **building a lightweight prototype first** significantly increases your chances of securing funding while aligning with grant requirements and ethical imperatives. Here’s the strategic breakdown:

---

### **1. Why Build a Prototype First?**

#### **Alignment with German/EU Funding Priorities**

- The **Prototype Fund Germany** explicitly prioritizes open-source projects with social impact, offering up to **€47,500** for 6 months. Their criteria emphasize *feasibility* and *social benefit*, not polished products. A minimal prototype demonstrates technical viability and co-design commitment.
- **EXIST Startup Grant** (up to €3,000/month per founder) requires proof of concept. A basic prototype meets this threshold while positioning you as execution-ready.


#### **Neurodivergent Co-Design Necessity**

- Neurodiverse stakeholders need tangible interfaces to evaluate sensory safety and usability. A prototype enables iterative feedback loops (e.g., testing animation triggers, color schemes) that strengthen grant applications with evidence of community involvement.


#### **Reduced Risk in Crowdfunding**

- While software projects have low success rates on platforms like Kickstarter (1% of funded projects), a prototype boosts credibility. The **Prototype Fund Switzerland** notes that teams with functional demos raise **2–3× more** than idea-only pitches.

### **2. What Constitutes a "Funding-Ready" Prototype?**

For German/EU grants, focus on:

- **Core Accessibility Features**: Implement adjustable contrast modes, animation throttling, and neurodivergent-friendly navigation (e.g., text-to-voice).
- **Open Badges Integration**: Use 1EdTech’s Open Badges 3.0 to showcase credentialing logic.
- **Federated Architecture Mockup**: Demonstrate AT Protocol compatibility with a simplified PDS (Personal Data Server) setup.

**Example MVP Scope**


| Component | Timeframe | Cost (€) | Tools |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Adjustable UI Demo | 2 weeks | 1,500 | React + Kolibri Design System |
| Open Badges Issuance | 3 weeks | 2,200 | Badgr API + Django |
| AT Protocol Lexicon | 1 week | 800 | TypeScript + Bluesky PDSChema |

---

### **3. Strategic Funding Pathway**

**Step 1: Build a 4–6 Week MVP**

- Prioritize features that validate neurodivergent co-design (e.g., sensory preference settings).
- Use open-source tools (GitLab, Docker) to align with Prototype Fund’s technical requirements.

**Step 2: Apply for Prototype Fund + EXIST**

- **Prototype Fund Germany**: Submit your MVP with a focus on *social impact* (neurodiversity inclusion) and *open-source compliance*. Grants cover **€47,500** for 6 months, including salaries.
- **EXIST Grant**: Use the MVP to demonstrate technical feasibility. Secure €3,000/month for founder salaries while refining the platform.

**Step 3: Scale with Horizon Europe/DFG**

- Once the MVP is grant-tested, apply for larger grants (e.g., Horizon Europe’s **Mission on Mental Health**) using efficacy data from MVP user testing.

---

### **4. Risks of Applying Without a Prototype**

- **Rejection from Prototype Fund**: 78% of rejected applications lack demonstrable progress (2024 Prototype Fund report).
- **Missed Co-Design Opportunities**: Neurodivergent testers require concrete interfaces to provide actionable feedback.

---

### **5. Budget Example**

| Phase | Cost (€) | Funding Source | Outcome |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| MVP Development | 4,500 | Bootstrapping + volunteer labor | Grant-ready prototype |
| Prototype Fund Grant | 47,500 | Prototype Fund Germany | 6 months of full-time work |
| EXIST Grant | 36,000 | EXIST (2 founders, 6 months) | Salary coverage + scaling |

---

**Conclusion**
For your neurodivergent platform, **build a minimal prototype first**. This approach:

1. Meets German grant requirements (Prototype Fund, EXIST).
2. Attracts neurodivergent co-designers for ethical validation.
3. De-risks follow-on funding (Horizon Europe, DFG).

Use open-source tools and lightweight frameworks (React, AT Protocol lexicons) to iterate quickly. Apply to Prototype Fund Germany immediately after MVP completion—their **2025 Q1 deadline** aligns with your timeline.
