# Designing Software Interfaces for Neurodivergent Users (ADHD & Bipolar Disorder)

Designing effective, accessible interfaces for neurodivergent users requires understanding their unique cognitive needs. Below, we focus on two groups – users with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and users with Bipolar Disorder – outlining key design principles, features, and examples that support their engagement and wellbeing.

## ADHD: Designing for Focus and Consistency

### Helping Users Stay on Task and Maintain Focus

- **Clear Task Breakdown & Guidance:** Break complex tasks or forms into smaller, manageable steps with straightforward instructions. Use simple language and guide users step-by-step so they don't feel overwhelmed. For example, multi-step workflows should indicate progress (e.g. a step indicator or progress bar) so users always know how far along they are. This helps an ADHD user remain anchored to the process and less likely to abandon it.

- **Reminders and Notifications:** Provide timely reminders, prompts, or to-do notifications to pull users back to important tasks or goals. These can mitigate forgetfulness – a common ADHD challenge – by nudging the user to re-focus on pending activities. For instance, language-learning app Duolingo sends daily push notifications encouraging practice, helping users stick to their routine. Such gentle prompts keep goals salient without the user having to remember everything on their own.

- **Visible Time and Limits:** Incorporate tools to help manage "time-blindness." Ensure the current time or a timer is visible during full-screen activities so users don't lose track of time. It can also be useful to offer optional focus timers or usage limits that remind users to take breaks after long periods. (For example, iOS Screen Time can alert a user every 15 minutes of app use, requiring them to consciously extend usage – a feature that can rein in hyperfocus.) These measures help users self-regulate and stay on task in a balanced way.

- **Progress Tracking and Feedback:** Give users clear feedback on task completion and goal progress to maintain motivation. Visual progress bars, checklists that show items checked off, or end-of-day summaries of completed work can reinforce a sense of accomplishment. For example, the task app TickTick generates a daily summary of completed tasks, providing a tangible record of progress that helps users with ADHD reflect on what they achieved. Positive reinforcement – like congratulatory messages or reward points for completing tasks – can also encourage sustained focus. In fact, using a "high-reinforcement environment" (rewarding completed tasks with positive language or gamified rewards) is recommended to keep ADHD users engaged. Even productivity tools can borrow this tactic from games and educational software to celebrate small wins (though care should be taken that it doesn't feel patronizing).

### Reducing Overstimulation and Distractions

- **Minimalist, Uncluttered Layout:** Use a clean, well-organized interface that avoids clutter. A neat, uncluttered layout helps all users, but especially those with ADHD, to focus on what matters without getting sidetracked. It's often better to allow scrolling or multiple screens than to cram too much at once. Keep navigation simple and consistent (avoid deep, convoluted menus that could confuse or distract). Each screen should have a clear purpose so the user isn't bombarded with irrelevant options.

- **Controlled Visual Stimulation:** While simplicity is key, completely bare interfaces can be under-stimulating – which for an ADHD mind can lead to wandering attention. Striking a balance is important: don't be afraid to use bold text, color highlights, or engaging visuals for key content to sustain interest. However, avoid flashing, flickering, or constantly moving elements that hijack attention. Animations should be used sparingly; for example, animated GIFs or autoplay videos in a reading pane can make it nearly impossible for an ADHD user to concentrate on the text. Give users control over media playback (no surprise sounds or videos upon page load) – let them opt in to stimulation rather than forcing it.

- **Limiting Interruptions:** Avoid intrusive pop-ups or modal dialogs that appear at random and derail the user's flow. An ADHD-friendly design eschews disruptive interstitials like sudden newsletter sign-ups or ads while the user is in the middle of a task. If something must interrupt (say, a session timeout), make it as subtle and context-appropriate as possible. Keeping the user's workflow uninterrupted helps sustain focus. Similarly, consider integrating with "focus mode" settings on devices to suppress non-essential notifications from other apps while your app is in use.

- **Sensory Considerations:** Many people with ADHD experience sensory sensitivities or overload. Providing options like a Dark Mode (to reduce harsh screen brightness) can make your software more comfortable for light-sensitive users. Likewise, ensure the interface works well in quiet mode: if your application has sound effects, allow them to be muted or turned off by default, so users aren't startled or distracted by audio (which they may be extra sensitive to). By allowing personalization of sensory input (e.g. adjusting color themes, sound, motion), you accommodate a wider range of attention needs and comfort levels.

### Goal-Setting and Progress Management Features

- **Structured Goal Planning:** Help users translate goals into concrete steps within the interface. This could be through built-in to-do list functionality, project boards, or templates that guide goal breakdown. Encourage setting realistic sub-goals and deadlines so that big tasks don't feel amorphous. For example, an educational app might let a student set a goal ("finish a module by Friday") and then suggest a schedule or milestones toward it. By externalizing goal structure, the interface compensates for executive function challenges.

- **Visual Goal Tracking:** Make goal progress visible. Dashboards or profiles showing streaks, completed milestones, or skill levels achieved can give ADHD users an overview of where they stand. Visual indicators (like a progress circle that fills in as tasks are done, or a experience-point bar that grows) tap into the brain's reward system, which is especially effective for ADHD motivation. Duolingo, for instance, uses streak counts and leveling-up as visual motivation alongside its daily goals – techniques that have kept many ADHD learners engaged in building a habit.

- **Reminders for Routines and Deadlines:** Integrate calendars and reminder systems to assist with time management. Auto-reminders for upcoming deadlines or scheduled study/work sessions help users initiate tasks on time. These can be notifications or in-app prompts (e.g. "Time to review your flashcards!"). Consistency in these prompts (same time of day, or triggered by context) can aid in forming routines.

- **Positive Reinforcement and Gamification:** As noted, rewarding progress is beneficial. Consider features like badges, points, or unlocking content when goals are met. Even a simple congratulatory message for completing today's to-do list can boost morale. One case study in design for ADHD recommends using positive language and rewards for task completion as a core principle. For productivity apps, this might mean an encouraging message or fun animation when a project is marked done. Gamification should be balanced (too many game elements could become distracting in themselves), but when done right, they provide structure and incentive that align with how ADHD brains often respond well to immediate feedback.

### Examples of ADHD-Friendly UI in Education and Productivity

Real-world software has begun to embody these principles to support users with ADHD:

- **Educational Apps:** Duolingo keeps learners on track with daily goals, streaks, and reminder notifications, using a clean interface that focuses the user on one exercise at a time. Its visual rewards (XP points, progress bars) and short lesson chunks help maintain focus and momentum. Similarly, Khan Academy breaks lessons into bite-sized videos and quizzes, using a consistent layout and gentle prompts to continue, which can prevent students from feeling overwhelmed. Both platforms avoid clutter and use friendly, positive feedback (like celebratory animations) to reward learning progress – techniques known to improve engagement for ADHD students.

- **Productivity Apps:** Amazing Marvin (a task manager app) is often cited as an ADHD-friendly productivity tool because of its highly customizable interface. Users can tailor the app's workflows to their personal style – choosing color themes, enabling or disabling features (like timers, gamified rewards, etc.), and even selecting from templates of productivity methods (Kanban boards, Pomodoro timers, etc.). This flexibility lets individuals with ADHD create a system that holds their attention and suits their needs, whether they need playful elements or extra simplicity. In the words of one reviewer, Marvin's 100% customization means users can pick everything from "productivity strategies to your own rewards," making it easier to build an ideal task system that actually sticks.

- **Focus Aids:** There are also apps like Forest and Focus@Will designed to help maintain concentration. Forest uses gamification in a minimal way – if you stay off your phone and on task, a virtual tree grows, giving a visual reward for focus. Focus@Will provides background music engineered to improve concentration. These tools reduce external distractions and add mild, controlled stimulation (background visuals or sound), aligning with expert tips for focusing with ADHD (e.g. some find soft background noise helpful, while eliminating disruptive notifications).

- **Built-in Device Features:** Mainstream platforms have started including focus features benefiting neurodivergent users. For example, Windows and macOS have "Focus Assist" or "Do Not Disturb" modes that silence non-urgent notifications so the user can work uninterrupted. Browser reader modes strip away ads and sidebars for distraction-free reading – useful for an ADHD user trying to read an article without getting sidetracked. Such features, while not exclusively for ADHD, exemplify inclusive design that can significantly help those users stay engaged.

- **Other Noteworthy Features:** Small design choices can make a big difference. For instance, Google Chrome's offline dinosaur game is a clever way to occupy users during wait times (like a lost internet connection). Instead of frustration or distraction during an unavoidable pause, the simple game provides a moment of play. This keeps an ADHD user from wandering off to a new task out of impatience, and turns a potential disruption into a harmless break. It's an example of understanding user temperament and designing a considerate, even fun, experience for moments that usually trigger distraction. Likewise, productivity tools that include an "Open Recent" files/projects list or persistent notes of "where you left off" help users quickly reorient after interruptions. Such features ensure that if attention does shift, coming back is easier – the context is saved by the software, not solely the user's memory.

## Bipolar Disorder: Designing for Mood Variability and Stability

Designing interfaces for bipolar users requires accommodating a broad range of mental states. Bipolar disorder is characterized by shifts between high-energy, high-activity states (mania or hypomania) and low-energy, depressive states. A user's needs and behaviors can differ drastically across these moods. Thus, designing a user interface for bipolar patients is challenging and must consider interaction patterns during both manic and depressive episodes. Key goals are to support long-term self-management (through mood tracking and routine) and to provide a stable, reassuring user experience through mood swings.

### Long-Term Digital Solutions for Managing Shifts (Mania vs. Depression)

- **Consistent, Stable UI:** Bipolar users benefit from a consistent interface that doesn't add to the emotional volatility. Aim for a predictable design with minimal sudden changes or surprise interactions (echoing the ADHD principle to "minimize surprises" which is equally applicable here). In manic phases, users might be more impulsive and prone to racing through the app, so clarity and confirmation are key; in depressive phases, users might be easily overwhelmed, so simplicity and gentle guidance help. A well-structured, calm interface can serve as an anchor. As one set of design guidelines notes, a routine and consistent structure in software is helpful for users with cognitive differences, reducing confusion and providing a sense of order. This consistency can be soothing when mood and energy are chaotic.

- **Adaptive or Flexible Interaction:** While the core UI remains consistent, consider features that adapt to the user's current state or allow the user to switch modes. For example, in a manic/hyperactive state a user might appreciate a "calm mode" – an option to reduce visual clutter or limit functionality to prevent over-activity (e.g., lock spending features if it's a finance app, or enable a timer to remind them to take breaks). Conversely, in a depressive state, a "low-energy mode" might simplify the interface and highlight the most essential actions to gently encourage engagement without demanding too much. Even if automatic detection isn't feasible, giving users manual control to toggle certain assistive settings depending on how they feel can empower them. In all cases, safety nets for impulsive actions are important – e.g., confirmations or delay mechanisms on critical irreversible actions (like deleting data or sending messages) can prevent regretful mistakes during manic impulsivity.

- **Integrated Psychoeducation and Coping Tools:** Long-term management of bipolar disorder often involves learning personal triggers and coping strategies for mood swings. Software can reinforce these by embedding psychoeducational content and just-in-time coping tools. For instance, an app might include modules or tips that the user can refer to during high or low periods (like relaxation exercises for agitation in mania, or mood-lifting activities for depression). The Life Goals self-management app for BD took this approach: it aligned coping strategy guidance with the user's personal goals, offering modules for issues like depression and anxiety that users could work through as needed. By providing resources tailored to each pole of mood, the interface supports users through the entire cycle. The key is to keep such resources easily accessible (e.g., a "Help" or "Tools" section that's one tap away) so that in moments of need – when concentration is low or agitation is high – the user can quickly find support without frustration.

- **Early Warning and Episode Management:** Digital solutions can aid in predicting or mitigating mood episodes. Where appropriate, incorporate passive monitoring features that can act as early warning systems. A pioneering example is the app BiAffect, which unobtrusively tracks smartphone keyboard dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, error rate) as a way to detect impending manic or depressive episodes. It analyzes these patterns with AI to find "digital biomarkers" of mood shifts, aiming to alert users to brewing episodes before they fully manifest. While not every app will implement something as advanced as BiAffect, even simple checks can help – for example, if an app notices unusually rapid activity input by the user (multiple tasks added in a short time, or a sudden spike in usage at odd hours), it might prompt: "How are you feeling? You seem very active – consider reviewing your mood." The goal is to foster awareness. Additionally, incorporating a crisis plan feature can be valuable: allow users to record what they'd like to do or who to contact when feeling very low or very high. If signs of an extreme state appear, the app can then gently remind them of their pre-decided plan (e.g., "Remember to call your support person" or "Take a few deep breaths – check your coping strategies list"). These kinds of long-term supports turn the interface into a companion in managing bipolar swings, not just a static tool.

### Tools for Tracking Activity Levels and Mood Shifts

- **Mood and Symptom Tracking:** A cornerstone of bipolar self-management is regular mood tracking. Software should make it easy to log mood states (e.g., using a simple daily rating scale, mood emojis, or journaling prompt). Ideally, mood tracking is done in real-time or daily, since patterns are crucial. Along with mood, allow logging of related factors: sleep duration, energy level, irritability, anxiety, etc. In fact, research into bipolar apps found a broad set of features beneficial for monitoring, including sleep schedules, energy level evaluation, irritability, speech patterns, self-confidence, concentration, anxiety levels, and more, as well as life factors like medication adherence and substance use. Not every app will capture all these, but giving users a way to record the key predictors of their mood shifts (for example, many bipolar users track their nightly hours of sleep because of its strong impact on mood) is vital.

- **Activity and Behavior Tracking:** Beyond self-reported mood, incorporate tracking of objective activity data when possible. Smartphones and wearables can supply useful signals – physical activity (step count, exercise), social activity (number of phone calls or messages), or physiological data (heart rate, sleep quality from a smartwatch). These can be presented back to the user alongside their mood logs, helping them see correlations (e.g., "On days when your activity level was low, your mood tended to be low"). Such data can sometimes catch mood shifts the user isn't consciously aware of. For example, a sudden surge in late-night phone usage might foreshadow mania; decreased movement might foreshadow depression. The MONARCA system is an example that combines subjective and objective tracking: it lets bipolar patients enter daily self-assessments for mood, sleep, activity, etc., while also collecting passive sensor data from the phone (like movement sensors). By blending these, MONARCA can provide a rich picture of the user's state and even send suggestions based on the data (for instance, if warning signs are detected).

- **Visualizing Patterns Over Time:** It's important that the app not only collect data but also present it in an insightful, user-friendly way. Charts or timelines that show mood over days, weeks, and months help users and clinicians spot patterns or triggers. Many bipolar apps include mood graphs where one axis is time and the other is mood level; often these are overlaid with other tracked metrics (sleep, meds, etc.). Ensure these visualizations are clear and not overly technical – they should be understandable even during a cognitive slump. Ideally, the interface can highlight notable trends (e.g., "three low-mood days in a row" or "mood swings becoming more frequent"). This aligns with best-practice features identified in research: one study found that essential functions included providing charts of collected data and even the ability to send or share these data with providers for review. For instance, a chart that a user can share with their therapist showing the past 30 days of mood and activity can greatly improve clinical conversations.

- **Medication and Treatment Adherence:** Since treatment consistency (like taking medication regularly) is crucial in bipolar management, interfaces often include med tracking or reminders. Simple features such as a daily pill reminder alarm, or a checklist of whether medication was taken, can be lifesavers for maintaining stability. This can be integrated into the routine tracking interface. Some apps also allow logging side effects, which can be useful for doctor consultations. The main idea is to treat these health management tasks as part of the user's daily interaction with the app – keeping it all in one place increases the likelihood that the user will maintain the habit.

- **Community and Support Integration:** While not an interface element per se, providing access to community (forums, peer support groups) or caregiver connectivity can be valuable. A few bipolar apps include a feature to designate a caregiver or clinician who can access the user's mood data (with consent) or be alerted if things look concerning. Knowing that their support network is integrated may encourage users to keep up with tracking and feel less alone. For example, MONARCA allows patients to share their data with clinicians and even customize warning signs that, if triggered, could notify care providers. From a design standpoint, these features should be user-controlled and privacy-minded, but when used, they turn the app into a collaborative tool between patient and supporter.

### Interface Designs for Balanced Engagement and Routine Maintenance

- **Encouraging a Steady Routine:** Maintaining regular daily routines (sleeping, eating, activity times) is often recommended to help prevent bipolar episodes. An interface can support this by nudging users toward consistency. For instance, the app could allow users to set personalized routine goals (e.g., target bedtime, or a reminder to take a walk every afternoon) and then send gentle reminders or motivational prompts at those times. Regular daily check-ins (at the same time each day) not only gather data but also create a grounding ritual for the user. The design should make these check-ins quick and easy – a simple notification that takes the user directly to a one-minute mood & routine log. Over time, this becomes a habit that can anchor the day. In one study, designers noted that software can encourage breaks and routine by prompting users to take rests after long use or by limiting continuous usage, as well as by making it easy to resume after a break so users don't resist taking one. In practice, an app might say, "You've been using the app for 30 minutes – how about a short break?" during a manic usage streak, or conversely, ping a user who hasn't checked in by midday (during a possible depressive inertia) with a positive, low-pressure prompt ("How are you doing? Recording how you feel might help.").

- **Balanced Engagement vs. Overuse:** Design for bipolar users should avoid the trap of encouraging excessive engagement. Many apps and platforms try to maximize time-on-app, but for mental health, quality of engagement is more important than quantity. During manic phases, a person might over-engage (for example, obsessively inputting data or scrolling through graphs). The interface might gently curtail this by not having endless content to scroll. Once the user has done the intended tasks (logged mood, read a coping tip, etc.), the app can suggest closing it and doing something offline. This is a bit unusual in design (telling users not to use the app), but in context it's a humane feature. Some apps implement this by having a clear end to the daily interaction – e.g., after submitting a nightly reflection, the app might display a calming message like "Thanks for checking in. See you tomorrow!" rather than offering more clickable distractions. On the other hand, during depressive periods, the hurdle is under-engagement. Here, the design should lower barriers to use: keep login or access simple (no need to re-enter passwords frequently – use device authentication), show a friendly greeting even if the user hasn't engaged lately, and perhaps provide an encouraging note or highlight one small thing the user can do in the app to start (like "Write one sentence about how you feel" or "Tap an emoji that matches your mood"). By adjusting the tone to be encouraging but not pushy, the interface can invite the user back gently.

- **Routine-Building Features:** Features like streak tracking or calendars can be double-edged for bipolar users. On one hand, seeing a streak of successfully logged days can motivate routine maintenance. On the other, an inevitable break in routine (due to an episode) could lead to feelings of failure. Design these elements with compassion: for instance, if showing streaks or continuous days, also emphasize that breaks are okay. Some habit apps handle this by showing the percentage of days logged rather than an all-or-nothing streak, or by allowing users to "freeze" a streak during difficult times. Another approach is framing routine tracking in positive language – e.g., instead of "you missed yesterday," say "you've logged 5 days this week" focusing on what was done. The principle of using positive reinforcement and forgiving design is crucial here, to encourage consistency without punishing lapses.

- **Personalization and Control:** Just as with ADHD, giving users some control over how they engage can improve adherence. Perhaps the user can set the frequency of check-ins or the type of reminders that help them most. One person might want a firm alarm-like reminder at 9 PM to fill their daily log, another might prefer a gentle in-app reminder they see whenever they open the app. By allowing them to configure these, you respect individual differences in routine-building. The user-centered, iterative design of systems like MONARCA – which was developed with direct input from bipolar patients – highlights the value of tailoring to user preferences. The result was an app that users found acceptable and helpful in maintaining their regimen, in part because it fit into their lives rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all routine.

### Features to Help Users Recover After Extreme States

- **Easy Resumption After Breaks:** It's common for bipolar individuals to fall out of using apps during extreme highs or lows – e.g., someone in a depressive episode might not log in for two weeks. Design with the assumption that periodic disengagement will happen, and make returning feel safe and simple. One best practice is to allow quick saving and exiting, and resuming without hassle. In practical terms, that means the user should never lose data or configuration because they were absent. If they open the app after a long break, greet them warmly ("Welcome back") instead of admonishing them for inactivity. Avoid overwhelming them with a backlog of notifications or data – instead of "You missed 14 mood logs!", the app could present a single summary ("Here's what happened while you were away…") or simply focus on starting fresh today. The idea is to reduce any shame or anxiety about the gap in usage.

- **Gradual Re-engagement:** If the app involves tasks or lessons (for example, an educational or therapy app with a schedule), provide a way to recalibrate after a hiatus. Perhaps offer a quick recap of the last accomplished milestone and a suggestion for a next small step, rather than expecting the user to pick up a complex task where they left off. For instance, if it's a habit-building app and the user broke their streak, the app might say "It's okay to take breaks. Let's start again today – one step at a time." By explicitly acknowledging that breaks are normal and recovery is possible, the interface can reduce the intimidation factor. Some wellness apps have a feature like "Restart Plan" or "Continue from last checkpoint" to facilitate this.

- **Maintain Context:** Design the system to preserve as much of the user's context as possible through inactivity. All their past data and settings should be there when they return (unless they deliberately wiped it). Seeing continuity – like previous mood entries, journal notes, or goal lists – can help them reconnect with their progress rather than feeling like they are starting from zero. For example, if a user hasn't used a journaling feature in a while, the app can highlight their last entry date and perhaps encourage reading past entries as a way to reflect and restart. This leverages the data the user provided in more active times to help pull them out of a low period.

- **Responsive to Relapse:** In the context of bipolar disorder, a "break" in using the app might coincide with an episode relapse. The interface can be designed to be an ally in those times. If a depressive episode caused disengagement, upon return the app could gently suggest resources (like "Things have been tough – would you like to revisit your coping strategies or contact your support?"). If a manic spell led to overactivity and then a crash, the app might adapt by, say, helping the user review any data input during mania with a clear head (e.g., if they logged dozens of goals impulsively, maybe present them in a manageable list to prioritize now). This kind of context-aware adjustment is advanced, but even a simple supportive message can help the user feel understood. The key is empathy: design the tone and flow for a returning user in a way that conveys "we're here to help you get back on track" instead of any sense of reprimand.

- **Real-World Example – MONARCA's Approach:** The MONARCA bipolar management system recognized the need for easy re-engagement. It sends daily reminders to encourage consistent use, but also focuses on seamless data continuity – users can easily resume entering self-assessments, and their data is all aggregated for review without punishment for missing days. Moreover, because MONARCA was developed with clinician connectivity, if a user dropped off entirely, a clinician might reach out – showing how design can integrate human support for reactivation. While not every app involves clinicians, designers can consider similar human-in-the-loop support (even if it's as simple as encouraging the user to talk to someone if they haven't checked in for a long time). The overall lesson is to build the interface as a continuous support system that adapts to the user's ups and downs, remaining helpful and nonjudgmental through all phases of engagement.

## Summary

In summary, designing for neurodivergent users like those with ADHD or bipolar disorder means prioritizing clarity, flexibility, and empathy in your UI/UX. For ADHD, interfaces should minimize extraneous distractions, provide structure (but not tedium), and use timely cues and rewards to keep users engaged and on track. For bipolar disorder, the software should act as a stable companion through mood changes – facilitating tracking and routine to provide insight and early warnings, while being gentle, adaptable, and forgiving in the face of extreme states. Many of these practices overlap with general good design and accessibility principles (what helps these users often benefits everyone). By studying real-world successes – from gamified learning apps to mood-tracking tools co-designed with patients – designers can gather proven ideas and avoid pitfalls. Ultimately, the best interfaces for neurodivergent users are those built with understanding and inclusion, empowering users to achieve their goals and manage challenges in a way that feels supportive rather than burdensome. With thoughtful features and user-centered iteration, software can significantly improve focus, stability, and quality of life for people with ADHD, bipolar disorder, and beyond.
