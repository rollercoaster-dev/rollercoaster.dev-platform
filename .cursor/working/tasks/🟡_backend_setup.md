# Backend API Setup with Hono and Bun

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:** Set up a functional backend API with basic CRUD operations and database connectivity
- **Energy Level:** High ðŸ”‹ (requires focus and technical decision-making)
- **Status:** âœ… Completed

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Tools/Files:**
  - `backend/index.ts`
  - `backend/package.json` (has Hono installed)
  - `backend/tsconfig.json`
- **Additional Needs:**
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Database migration tool
  - Environment configuration
- **Related Files:**
  - `.cursor/working/development-plan.md`

## 3. Ideas & Challenges
- **Approaches:**
  - Use a modular architecture for easy maintenance
  - Implement repository pattern for database operations
  - Set up middleware for error handling and validation
  - Use Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Potential Issues:**
  - Database connection management in development
  - Type safety between frontend and backend
  - Error handling standardization
- **Decision Log:**
  - Using Hono for API framework (lightweight, fast, TypeScript support)
  - PostgreSQL for database (robust, supports JSON, good for badge metadata)
  - Drizzle ORM for database operations (type-safe, good Bun support)

## 4. Plan
- **Quick Wins:**
  - [x] Set up project structure (5 mins)
  - [x] Create health check endpoint (10 mins)
  - [x] Add basic error handling middleware (15 mins)

- **Major Steps:**
  1. Project Structure Setup (30 mins) âœ…
     - Create directory structure for routes, middleware, db, etc.
     - Set up environment configuration
     - Add necessary dependencies

  2. Database Integration (1 hour) âœ…
     - Install and configure Drizzle ORM
     - Create database connection utility
     - Set up initial migrations
     - Implement basic health check query
     - Create badge repository
     - Add Docker support for development

  3. Core API Features (2 hours) âœ…
     - Create badge CRUD operations
     - Add badge-engine integration
     - Add error handling
     - Implement database persistence

  4. Testing & Documentation (1 hour) âœ…
     - Add basic integration tests
     - Create API documentation
     - Add development setup instructions
     - Create test scripts for database validation

## 5. Execution
- **Progress Updates:**
  - [x] Project structure created
    - Set up all necessary directories
    - Implemented basic file structure
  - [x] Health check endpoint added
    - Created `/health` route
    - Added logging middleware
    - Configured hot reloading
  - [x] Error handling added
    - Created error handling middleware with proper types
    - Added custom APIError class
    - Implemented test error route
    - Fixed ContentfulStatusCode typing issues
  - [x] Core routes implemented
    - Created badges API endpoints (CRUD operations)
    - Added badge-engine integration service
    - Implemented external API client with fallback
  - [x] Tests added
    - Created test scripts for API functionality
    - Added badge creation and update tests
  - [x] Badge-engine integration added
    - Created badgeEngineService for API communication
    - Updated badge types with external references
    - Added graceful fallbacks for badge-engine availability
    - Created development script for running both services
- **Context Resume Point:**
  Last working on: Badge-engine API integration
  Next planned action: Database Integration (Step 2 of Major Steps)
    1. Install Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL dependencies
    2. Set up environment configuration
    3. Create database connection utility
  Current blockers: None

## 6. Next Actions & Blockers
- **Immediate Next Actions:** 
  - [x] Install database dependencies: drizzle-orm, postgres (5 mins)
  - [x] Create .env.example with database configuration (5 mins)
  - [x] Set up database connection utility (15 mins)
  - [x] Migrate from in-memory storage to database (30 mins)
  - [x] Set up Docker for development environment (25 mins)
  - [x] Test database operations (15 mins)
  - [ ] Add production deployment documentation (Optional)
  - [ ] Set up continuous integration (Optional)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None, all critical tasks completed

## 7. Reflections
- **Observations:** 
  - Starting with a clean, well-organized structure helped maintain focus
  - The badge-engine integration revealed the importance of resilient service design with fallbacks
  - Designing for external service integration from the start creates a more maintainable system
- **Focus Analysis:** 
  - Breaking into small, completable units helped maintain momentum
  - Creating test scripts early provided confidence in implementation
  - Service abstraction made the badge-engine integration much smoother
- **Celebration Notes:** 
  - ðŸŽ‰ Initial project structure and dependencies in place
  - ðŸŽ‰ Health check endpoint working
  - ðŸŽ‰ Error handling middleware implemented with proper typing
  - ðŸŽ‰ Badge API endpoints fully implemented with CRUD operations
  - ðŸŽ‰ Badge-engine integration complete with graceful fallbacks
  - ðŸŽ‰ Test scripts validate all API functionality
  - ðŸŽ‰ Database integration with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL
  - ðŸŽ‰ Docker development environment set up
  - ðŸŽ‰ Database operations tested and verified
