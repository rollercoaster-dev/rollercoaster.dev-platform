# VS Code-Inspired UI Implementation

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:**  
  Create a VS Code-inspired UI for an Open Badge Platform with three main areas: filesystem explorer, badge editor, and AI assistant panel
- **Energy Level Required:** High ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹
- **Current Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## 2. Resources Inventory
- **Existing Tools/Files:**  
  - frontend/pages/editor.vue (initial mockup)
  - color_and_accessibility_rule.mdc
  - components_development_rule.mdc
- **Additional Needs:**  
  - Vue 3 with TypeScript
  - shadcn component library
  - bun-hono for backend API
- **Related Files:**  
  - To be created:
    - components/ui/* (shadcn components)
    - components/layout/* (layout components)
    - components/custom/* (custom components)

## 3. Initial Ideas & Brainstorming
- **Ideas:**  
  - Use recursive components for file tree
  - Implement drag-and-drop for file organization
  - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
  - Include focus mode for distraction-free editing
- **Potential Challenges:**  
  - Managing state between components
  - Ensuring smooth transitions for neurodivergent users
  - Maintaining performance with real-time updates
- **Decision Log:**
  - Decision: Use Vue 3 with TypeScript and script setup
  - Reasoning: Strong type safety and better maintainability
  - Alternatives Considered: React, Svelte

## 4. Preliminary Plan
- **Quick Wins:**
  - [ ] Set up basic project structure (5 mins)
  - [ ] Create component folders (5 mins)
  - [ ] Initialize color tokens (10 mins)
- **Major Steps:**  
  1. Left Sidebar Implementation: Create filesystem explorer (4 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - FilesystemTree.vue component
     - ProjectItem.vue component
     - Accessibility features
  2. Main Editor Area: Build editor and badge progress panel (6 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - EditorView.vue
     - FileTabs.vue
     - BadgeProgressPanel.vue
  3. Right Panel: Develop AI assistant interface (5 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - AIAssistantPanel.vue
     - ChatHistory.vue
     - ChatInput.vue
  4. Backend Integration: Create and connect API endpoints (8 hours) ðŸŽ¯

## 5. Execution Tracker
- **Progress Updates:**  
  - [ ] Project Structure: Created initial mockup in editor.vue
  - [ ] Component Planning: Outlined necessary components
  - [ ] Design System: Identified color tokens and accessibility requirements
- **Context Resume Point:**
  Last working on: frontend/pages/editor.vue
  Next planned action: Break down into smaller components
  Current blockers: None

## 6. Immediate Next Actions & Blockers
- **Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Create FilesystemTree.vue component (2 hours)
  - [ ] Set up basic styling with color tokens (1 hour)
  - [ ] Implement file tree recursion logic (2 hours)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None currently identified

## 7. Reflections
- **Observations:**  
  Initial mockup provides good foundation but needs proper component separation and accessibility improvements
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰
  - Successfully created initial mockup with basic functionality
  - Identified all major components needed
  - Clear understanding of accessibility requirements
