# Fullstack Development Setup: Bun + Hono + Vue

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:**  
  Create a streamlined fullstack development environment with Bun, Hono backend and Vue 3 frontend with shared types, easy-to-use scripts, and proper project structure
- **Energy Level Required:** Medium ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹
- **Current Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## 2. Resources Inventory
- **Existing Tools/Files:**  
  - frontend/pages/editor.vue (initial mockup)
  - color_and_accessibility_rule.mdc
  - components_development_rule.mdc
- **Additional Needs:**  
  - Bun runtime
  - Hono web framework
  - TypeScript for shared types
  - SQLite or similar for database
  - Dev environment scripts
  - Testing frameworks and utilities
- **Related Files:**  
  - Created:
    - backend/src/routes/badges.ts (API endpoints for badges)
    - shared/types/badge.ts (shared type definitions)
    - frontend/services/badgeService.ts (API client layer)
    - scripts/dev.sh (development environment script)
    - .cursor/working/agent/config/testing_strategy_rule.md (testing guidelines)
    - backend/tests/fixtures/badges.ts (test fixtures for badge data)
    - backend/tests/unit/routes/badges.test.ts (unit tests for badge routes)

## 3. Initial Ideas & Brainstorming
- **Ideas:**  
  - Use Bun's built-in SQLite support for simple data persistence
  - Create a dev container for consistent environment
  - Implement hot reloading for both frontend and backend
  - Share types between frontend and backend for type safety
  - Add combined start script to run both in development
  - Implement test-driven development with ADHD-friendly patterns
- **Potential Challenges:**  
  - Ensuring proper type sharing between frontend and backend
  - Setting up efficient hot reloading for development
  - Balancing simplicity with scalability for future growth
  - Maintaining testing discipline with neurodivergent-friendly practices
  - Resolving frontend dependency conflicts
- **Decision Log:**
  - Decision: Use Bun + Hono for backend
  - Reasoning: Fast runtime, lightweight framework, good TypeScript support
  - Alternatives Considered: Express.js, Fastify, NestJS (more complex)
  
  - Decision: Adopt TDD for development
  - Reasoning: Provides structure, quick feedback, and clear objectives that benefit ADHD developers
  - Alternatives Considered: Traditional development approach, BDD
  
  - Decision: Use standard comments rather than JSDoc style
  - Reasoning: Cleaner approach with TypeScript, avoiding mixing paradigms
  - Alternatives Considered: JSDoc style for all documentation

## 4. Preliminary Plan
- **Quick Wins:**
  - [x] Create basic project structure with frontend/backend/shared folders (10 mins)
  - [x] Initialize package.json files for root and backend (10 mins)
  - [x] Set up tsconfig.json files for proper TypeScript configuration (15 mins)
- **Major Steps:**  
  1. Backend Setup: Create Bun + Hono API scaffold (2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Install Bun and initialize project
     - [x] Set up Hono with TypeScript
     - [x] Create basic API endpoints for badges
  2. Frontend Integration: Implement API service layer (1.5 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Create service directory structure
     - [x] Implement typed API clients
     - [ ] Update frontend components to use API services
  3. Shared Types: Define shared TypeScript interfaces (1 hour) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Create Badge and other entity interfaces
     - [x] Set up proper import paths
     - [x] Ensure types are accessible to both frontend and backend
  4. Development Environment: Configure dev scripts and tools (2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Create scripts to run frontend and backend concurrently
     - [x] Set up hot reloading for both
     - [ ] Add optional dev container configuration
     - [ ] Fix frontend dependency issues
  5. Testing Strategy: Implement testing framework and initial tests (3 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Create testing strategy rule document
     - [x] Set up testing framework for backend
     - [ ] Set up testing framework for frontend
     - [x] Create initial tests for Badge API endpoints
     - [x] Run and validate backend tests

## 5. Execution Tracker
- **Progress Updates:**  
  - [x] Project Structure: Created shared directory and updated backend structure
  - [x] Badge API: Implemented CRUD endpoints for badges in backend
  - [x] Frontend Service: Created badgeService for API integration
  - [x] Dev Script: Created dev.sh to run frontend and backend concurrently
  - [x] Testing Strategy: Created comprehensive ADHD-friendly testing guidelines
  - [x] Backend Tests: Created test directory structure and initial tests for Badge API
  - [x] Test Execution: Ran backend tests successfully (3 passing tests)
  - [x] Badge-Engine Integration: Added external API service integration
    - Created badgeEngineService for backend API communication
    - Updated shared types to support external references
    - Enhanced frontend service to detect badge-engine managed badges
    - Added development script for running with badge-engine
  - [x] API Documentation: Updated README files with integration details
- **Context Resume Point:**
  Last working on: Badge-engine API integration and testing
  Next planned action: Fix frontend dependency issues and set up frontend testing
  Current blockers: Frontend dependency conflict with unicorn-magic package

## 6. Immediate Next Actions & Blockers
- **Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Fix frontend dependency issues (1 hour)
  - [ ] Test the full development environment by running scripts/dev.sh (15 mins)
  - [ ] Update one frontend component to use the badge service (30 mins)
  - [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for the Badge API (45 mins)
  - [ ] Set up frontend testing framework with Vitest (45 mins)
  - [ ] Complete database integration for badge storage (1 hour)
  - [ ] Test badge-engine sync with permanent storage (30 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - Frontend dependency conflict with unicorn-magic package and its toPath export

## 7. Reflections
- **Observations:**  
  The existing project structure was more complete than initially expected, which accelerated our progress. The backend already had Hono installed and a basic structure set up. Adding a testing strategy early helped ensure quality and provides a structured approach for development that benefits ADHD workflows. Following consistent code style (avoiding mixing JSDoc and TypeScript) makes the codebase more maintainable. Frontend dependency issues highlight the importance of having a robust package management system. Integrating with external services like badge-engine demonstrates the importance of resilient design with graceful fallbacks.
