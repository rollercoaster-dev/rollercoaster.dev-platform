# Data Layer Architecture Improvement

## Priority: HIGH ðŸš¨

## Current State Analysis
- Simple badge system in backend (to be deprecated)
- Badge-engine implements full IMS Global Open Badges specification
- Both services currently trying to coexist with different models
- Unnecessary complexity from maintaining two systems

## Objective
Migrate to badge-engine as the single source of truth for badge management:
- Eliminate duplicate badge system
- Create clean integration with badge-engine
- Leverage full Open Badges feature set
- Simplify maintenance and development

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Badge-engine Capabilities Analysis
- [ ] Document Open Badges features available
- [ ] Map current use cases to badge-engine features
- [ ] Identify any gaps in functionality
- [ ] Review badge-engine API endpoints

### 2. Data Migration Planning
- [ ] Map current badge data to badge-engine schema
- [ ] Create migration script for existing badges
- [ ] Plan for handling in-progress badges
- [ ] Verify data integrity post-migration

### 3. Integration Architecture
- [ ] Design clean API client for badge-engine
- [ ] Plan error handling and fallback strategies
- [ ] Define caching strategy if needed
- [ ] Document integration patterns

### 4. Frontend Updates
- [ ] Update frontend to use badge-engine models
- [ ] Adapt UI for richer badge features
- [ ] Handle any UX changes needed
- [ ] Update type definitions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Integration Setup
- [ ] Create badge-engine API client
- [ ] Set up proper error handling
- [ ] Implement connection pooling if needed
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring

### Phase 2: Data Migration
- [ ] Create data migration tools
- [ ] Test migration with sample data
- [ ] Plan migration window
- [ ] Create rollback strategy

### Phase 3: Frontend Updates
- [ ] Update frontend components
- [ ] Enhance UI for new features
- [ ] Update state management
- [ ] Add new badge-engine capabilities

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove old badge system
- [ ] Clean up deprecated endpoints
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies

## Success Criteria
1. All badge operations handled by badge-engine
2. Clean, well-documented integration
3. No data loss during migration
4. Improved feature set available to users
5. Simplified codebase
6. Better alignment with Open Badges standard

## Notes
- Focus on making the integration robust
- Document badge-engine features for team
- Consider monitoring and observability
- Plan for zero-downtime migration

## Next Actions
1. Begin badge-engine API analysis
2. Create integration prototype
3. Plan data migration strategy
4. Get team feedback on approach

## Time Estimate
- Initial integration setup: 1-2 days
- Data migration planning: 1 day
- Frontend updates: 2-3 days
- Testing and cleanup: 1-2 days
