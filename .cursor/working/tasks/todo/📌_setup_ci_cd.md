# CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:**  
  Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Energy Level Required:** High ðŸ”‹
- **Current Status:** ðŸ“Œ Todo

## 2. Resources Inventory
- **Existing Tools/Files:**
  - `frontend/` - Nuxt.js application
  - `backend/` - Bun/Hono server
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Container configuration
  - `package.json` files
  - Test suites (Vitest, Playwright)
- **Additional Needs:**
  - GitHub Actions configuration
  - Environment secrets setup
  - Deployment configuration
  - Docker registry access

## 3. Task Breakdown
- [ ] Initial Setup
  - [ ] Create `.github/workflows` directory
  - [ ] Set up repository secrets
  - [ ] Configure Docker registry access

- [ ] Frontend CI Pipeline
  - [ ] Lint checks
  - [ ] Type checking
  - [ ] Unit tests with Vitest
  - [ ] E2E tests with Playwright
  - [ ] Build step
  - [ ] Docker image creation

- [ ] Backend CI Pipeline
  - [ ] Lint checks
  - [ ] Type checking
  - [ ] Unit tests
  - [ ] Build step
  - [ ] Docker image creation

- [ ] Deployment Configuration
  - [ ] Staging environment setup
  - [ ] Production environment setup
  - [ ] Health check endpoints
  - [ ] Rollback procedures

- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Pipeline documentation
  - [ ] Deployment process
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## 4. Time Estimates
- Initial Setup: 45 minutes
- Frontend Pipeline: 90 minutes
- Backend Pipeline: 60 minutes
- Deployment Config: 120 minutes
- Documentation: 45 minutes
**Total:** ~6 hours

## 5. Success Criteria
- All tests run automatically on pull requests
- Successful builds create Docker images
- Automated deployments to staging environment
- Manual approval required for production deployments
- Clear documentation for the entire CI/CD process
- Pipeline completion time under 15 minutes
- Proper error reporting and notifications
- Easy rollback capability
