# Dev Environment Setup

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:**  
  Create a single comprehensive script to start the entire development environment
- **Energy Level Required:** Medium ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹
- **Current Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Complete

## 2. Resources Inventory
- **Existing Tools/Files:**  
  - docker-compose-dev.yml
  - scripts/dev.sh
  - scripts/docker-dev.sh
  - scripts/dev-with-badge-engine.sh
- **Additional Needs:**  
  None
- **Related Files:**  
  - dev.sh (newly created)

## 3. Initial Ideas & Brainstorming
- **Ideas:**  
  - Combine functionality from existing scripts
  - Make the script check for prerequisites
  - Add colored output for better readability
  - Handle errors gracefully
  - Include log monitoring
- **Potential Challenges:**  
  - Ensuring proper cleanup on exit
  - Handling missing components (badge-engine)
- **Decision Log:**
  - Decision: Create a new master script at the root level
  - Reasoning: Easier access and better visibility
  - Alternatives Considered: Modifying existing scripts

## 4. Preliminary Plan
- **Quick Wins:**
  - [x] Review existing scripts (5 mins)
  - [x] Identify required components (5 mins)
- **Major Steps:**  
  1. Create new dev.sh script in project root (15 mins) ðŸŽ¯
  2. Add service startup logic with proper order (15 mins) ðŸŽ¯
  3. Implement error handling and graceful shutdown (10 mins) ðŸŽ¯
  4. Add log monitoring and status display (10 mins) ðŸŽ¯

## 5. Execution Tracker
- **Progress Updates:**  
  - [x] Created new dev.sh script
  - [x] Implemented Docker services startup
  - [x] Added database setup and service startup
  - [x] Implemented log monitoring
  - [x] Added proper cleanup on exit
- **Context Resume Point:**
  Last working on: dev.sh
  Next planned action: None - task complete
  Current blockers: None

## 6. Immediate Next Actions & Blockers
- **Next Actions:** 
  - [x] Make dev.sh executable (1 min)
  - [ ] Test the script to ensure it works as expected (10 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None

## 7. Reflections
- **Observations:**  
  The new dev.sh script combines functionality from multiple scripts while adding improved error handling,
  log monitoring, and better visual feedback. It also handles the case when badge-engine is not available.
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰
  Successfully created a single script that handles the entire development environment startup process!
