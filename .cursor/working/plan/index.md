# Rollercoaster.dev Platform Documentation

Welcome to the Rollercoaster.dev platform documentation. This index provides an overview of the available documentation for both the full vision and the MVP implementation.

## Project Overview

Rollercoaster.dev is an Open Badges-based learning platform designed specifically for neurodivergent users. The platform enables users to create and manage personal learning goals, create badges for others to earn, visualize learning progress, and engage in positive social interaction and mentoring.

2. [VS Code Interface Concept](./vs-code-interface-concept.md) - Details of the IDE-like interface design
3. [Skill Tree Visualization](./skill-tree-visualization.md) - Visualization features for badges and learning paths
4. [AI Integration](./ai-integration.md) - AI assistance features throughout the platform

### MVP Documentation

These documents define the Minimum Viable Product implementation:
