# Skill Tree Visualization

This document outlines the skill tree visualization feature for Rollercoaster.dev, providing users with interactive visual representations of their badge progress and learning paths.

## Visualization Overview

The skill tree visualization transforms badges and their relationships into intuitive, interactive visual maps that help users:

- Understand their learning progress
- Identify potential learning paths
- Discover relationships between skills
- Plan future learning goals
- Showcase achievements

## Visualization Types

### 1. Hierarchical Tree View

A traditional skill tree layout:

- Root nodes represent foundational skills
- Branches show specialization paths
- Leaves represent advanced or specialized badges
- Clear parent-child relationships
- Vertical or horizontal orientation options

### 2. Force-Directed Graph

A dynamic network visualization:

- Badges as nodes
- Relationships as edges
- Clusters form naturally based on relationships
- Interactive physics-based layout
- Zoom and pan navigation
- Node expansion/collapse

### 3. Timeline View

Progression visualization over time:

- Chronological display of earned badges
- Future planned achievements
- Milestone markers
- Progress tracking
- Time-based filtering

### 4. Radial/Sunburst View

Concentric organization of skills:

- Core skills at the center
- Specializations in outer rings
- Sector-based categorization
- Proportional representation of progress

## Visual Elements

### Badge Nodes

Each badge is represented as a node with:

- Badge image/icon
- Color coding by category or status
- Size variation based on importance or difficulty
- Status indicators (earned, in progress, locked)
- Completion percentage
- Interactive hover states

### Connections

Relationships between badges shown as:

- Directional arrows for prerequisites
- Line styles for different relationship types
- Strength indicators for relationship importance
- Animated flows for progress paths

### Progress Indicators

Visual cues for achievement status:

- Color gradients for completion levels
- Progress bars or rings
- Milestone markers
- Celebration effects for newly earned badges

## Interactive Features

### Navigation

- Zoom in/out for detail levels
- Pan to explore different areas
- Search and highlight specific badges
- Bookmark important views
- Reset to default view

### Filtering and Focus

- Filter by category, status, or date
- Focus on specific learning paths
- Highlight prerequisites for a target badge
- Show/hide completed badges
- Emphasize recommended next steps

### Node Interaction

- Click to expand/collapse node details
- Drag to rearrange (where applicable)
- Right-click context menu with actions
- Double-click to open badge details
- Hover for quick information

### Path Planning

- Visual path creation between badges
- Drag-and-drop badge sequencing
- Automatic path suggestion
- Difficulty assessment visualization
- Time estimation for paths

## Personalization

Users can customize their skill tree:

- Layout preferences
- Color schemes and themes
- Focus areas
- Default view settings
- Public/private visibility options

## Social Features

- Shareable skill tree snapshots
- Comparison views with peers or mentors
- Collaborative path planning
- Community badge recommendations
- Achievement showcasing

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies

- **D3.js**: Core visualization library
- **Vue.js**: Component integration
- **SVG**: Vector graphics rendering
- **Canvas**: Performance optimization for large trees
- **WebGL**: Optional 3D visualization for complex trees

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for large trees
- Level-of-detail rendering
- Pagination for extensive collections
- Caching of tree structures
- Optimized rendering for mobile devices

### Accessibility

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Alternative text representations
- High contrast modes
- Reduced motion options

## Use Cases

### Personal Progress Tracking

Users can visualize their learning journey:
- See completed badges and progress
- Identify gaps in knowledge
- Plan future learning

### Goal Setting

Visual planning for achievement:
- Map out learning paths
- Set milestone targets
- Visualize prerequisites

### Showcase and Sharing

Present achievements to others:
- Generate shareable visualizations
- Highlight expertise areas
- Create visual portfolios

### Community Exploration

Discover community learning patterns:
- View popular learning paths
- Explore badge relationships
- Find mentors with specific skills
