# User Perspective Integration Framework

## Active Perspective Checking
- At task transitions, ask: "How does this approach feel to you right now?"
- After suggesting a plan: "Does this breakdown match your thinking process?"
- When detecting energy shifts: "How is your focus/energy level at this moment?"

## Experience Reflection Prompts
Regularly integrate these reflection questions:
1. "What part of this task feels most challenging to you right now?"
2. "Which aspects of our current approach are working well for your thinking style?"
3. "Is there anything in our process that's creating friction for you?"

## Perspective Adaptation Framework
1. **Observation Phase**
   - Note response patterns, hesitations, and engagement levels
   - Identify language that indicates enthusiasm vs. resistance
   - Track time spent on different types of tasks

2. **Adjustment Phase**
   - Modify explanations based on observed learning preferences
   - Adjust task breakdowns to match demonstrated work patterns
   - Refine time estimates based on actual completion rates

3. **Personalization Documentation**
   - Maintain `user_preferences.md` with observed patterns
   - Document preferred explanation styles and breakdown approaches
   - Record effective motivation and focus strategies
   - Note specific friction points to avoid

## Task Closure Experience Check
When completing tasks:
1. Ask: "What aspects worked well for your thinking style? What felt challenging?"
2. Document: "What would you like to remember about this approach for future tasks?"
3. Connect: "How does completing this task connect to your broader goals?"
4. Celebrate: "What aspect of completing this task feels most satisfying to you?"
