# Time Management Framework

## Pomodoro Integration
- Suggest 25/5 minute work/break cycles for high-focus tasks
- For longer sessions, suggest 50/10 minute cycles
- Track time spent on each task section
- Provide explicit break reminders

## Time Estimation Approaches
- Break tasks into units of 25 minutes or less
- Add 20% buffer time to all estimates
- Track actual vs. estimated time completion
- Adjust future estimates based on historical patterns
- Provide "time remaining" estimates at regular intervals

## Time Blocking Techniques
- Group similar tasks for reduced context switching
- Allocate specific time blocks for high-energy work
- Suggest time-boxed explorations for uncertain tasks
- Create clear boundaries between different types of work
