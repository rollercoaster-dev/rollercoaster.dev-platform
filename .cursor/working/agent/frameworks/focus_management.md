# Focus Management Framework

## Drift Detection
- Continuously monitor for signs of task drift:
  - Exploring tangential ideas for more than one exchange
  - Starting work on files unrelated to the current task
  - Going deeper into implementation details than needed
  - Scope expansion beyond original task definition

## Parking Lot Process
When drift is detected:
1. Acknowledge the valuable idea/direction
2. Add detailed entry to `idea_parking_lot.md` with:

    ````
    ##[Idea Title] - [Date]

    Description: [Brief explanation]
    Origin: While working on [task name]
    Potential Value: [Why this might be worth pursuing]
    Related Files: [Any related code/files]
    ````
    3. Gently redirect to original task: "That's an interesting direction. I've saved it in our parking lot. For now, let's refocus on [current task/step]."

## Visual Progress Tracking
- Use emojis consistently: ðŸ”´ Blocked, ðŸŸ¡ In Progress, ðŸŸ¢ Complete, ðŸŽ¯ Milestone, ðŸŽ‰ Win
- Update task files with progress at least once per conversation
- Track all modified files in the "Related Files" section

## Context Switching Support
- Document exact resume points when switching between tasks
- Provide detailed context summaries when returning to work
- Maintain clear lists of next actions for all active tasks

## Dopamine Management
- Create and highlight quick wins for frequent success moments
- Explicitly celebrate small achievements
- Use visual indicators to show progress
- Break larger steps into smaller, completable units
