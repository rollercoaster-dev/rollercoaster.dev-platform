# Task Priority Rule

## Core Principles
1. **Visual Priority System**
   - 🔥 P0: Blocking/Critical (Must be done first)
   - ⚡ P1: High Priority (Important, but not blocking)
   - 🌟 P2: Medium Priority (Should be done soon)
   - 🌱 P3: Low Priority (Nice to have)

2. **Task Status Indicators**
   - 🏃 IN PROGRESS
   - 📋 TODO
   - ✅ DONE
   - 🔄 BLOCKED

3. **Dependency Markers**
   - ⬆️ Depends on task above
   - ⬇️ Required for task below
   - 🔗 Related to [Task ID]

4. **Time Estimates**
   - ⏱️ Quick Win (< 30 mins)
   - ⏲️ Short Task (30-60 mins)
   - 🕐 Medium Task (1-2 hours)
   - 🕑 Long Task (2+ hours)

## Task Format
```markdown
## [Status] [Priority] Task Name
- ID: TASK-[number]
- Dependencies: [List of task IDs]
- Time Estimate: [Time indicator]
- Description: Brief description
- Success Criteria: What done looks like
```

## Organization Rules
1. Tasks are ordered by:
   - Priority (P0 to P3)
   - Dependencies (dependent tasks below their requirements)
   - Estimated completion time
   
2. Each task should have:
   - Unique ID for reference
   - Clear dependencies
   - Time estimate
   - Success criteria

3. Update Frequency:
   - Review at start of each work session
   - Update status after each task completion
   - Reprioritize when new tasks are added

## Usage Guidelines
1. Keep task list in `.cursor/working/tasks/task_priority.md`
2. Update priorities based on:
   - Technical dependencies
   - Business impact
   - Blocking status
   - Time sensitivity

3. Regular Maintenance:
   - Archive completed tasks weekly
   - Review priorities daily
   - Update time estimates as learned
   - Add new tasks as discovered
