## Task Structure and Organization

Tasks in this project follow a structured format designed for clarity and focus:

```
.cursor/
â””â”€â”€ working/
    â””â”€â”€ tasks/
        â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸŸ¡_task_in_progress.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ”´_blocked_task.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“Œ_paused_task.md
        â””â”€â”€ completed/
            â””â”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢_completed_task.md
```

## Task Status Indicators

Use these emoji prefixes to indicate task status:
- **ðŸŸ¡ In Progress**: Active tasks you're currently working on
- **ðŸ”´ Blocked**: Tasks waiting on dependencies or external input
- **ðŸŸ¢ Complete**: Finished tasks (move to completed/ subfolder)
- **ðŸ“Œ Paused**: Temporarily suspended tasks

## Task File Template

Each task file should follow this template:

```markdown
# {TASK_NAME}

## ADHD-Supportive Task Practices

### Breaking Down Tasks

Always break larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces:
- **Time-boxed**: Estimate time requirements for each step
- **Concrete**: Define clear, specific actions
- **Achievable**: Ensure steps can be completed in one sitting
- **Visible**: Track progress visually with checkboxes

### Context Switching Support

When switching between tasks:
1. **Document Resume Points**: Note exactly where you left off
2. **Record Next Actions**: List the immediate next steps
3. **Capture Context**: Include any relevant mental context or decisions

### Dopamine Management

To work with ADHD brain chemistry:
1. **Quick Wins**: Start with small, achievable items
2. **Celebration Notes**: Document progress and small victories
3. **Visual Progress**: Use checkboxes and status emojis
4. **Immediate Rewards**: Define clear completion criteria

### Energy Management

Match tasks to your energy levels:
- **High Energy ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹**: Complex problem-solving, creative work, learning new concepts
- **Medium Energy ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹**: Implementing solutions, writing documentation, testing
- **Low Energy ðŸ”‹**: Simple updates, review, organization, clean-up tasks

## Task Creation Workflow

1. **Initial Assessment**: Define the objective and scope
2. **Create Task File**: Use the template format
3. **Break Down Steps**: Divide into manageable chunks
4. **Prioritize**: Mark quick wins and high-value steps
5. **Execute**: Work through the steps, updating as you go
6. **Review**: Reflect on progress and learnings
7. **Complete/Archive**: Move to completed folder when done

## Task Review Practices

Regular review of task documentation helps maintain momentum:

### Daily Review
- Check progress on active tasks
- Update status indicators
- Identify next actions for in-progress tasks

### Weekly Review
- Move completed tasks to the archive
- Reassess blocked tasks
- Prioritize upcoming work
- Review energy allocation

## Documentation Standards

- **Clear Language**: Use plain, direct language
- **Visual Separation**: Use headings, lists, and spacing
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Most important information first
- **Action-Oriented**: Frame items as specific actions
- **State Awareness**: Clearly mark the current status
